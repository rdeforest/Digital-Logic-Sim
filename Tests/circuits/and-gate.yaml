name: AND gate (2 NANDs)
cycles: 1000
circuit:
  inputs:
    - in0: 1bit
    - in1: 1bit
  outputs:
    - out0: 1bit
  parts:
    - nand0: {type: nand}  # First NAND for inputs
    - nand1: {type: nand}  # Second NAND to invert (making AND)
  wires:
    # Inputs to first NAND
    - from: in0
      to: nand0.in0
    - from: in1
      to: nand0.in1
    # First NAND output to second NAND (NOT gate)
    - from: nand0.out0
      to: [nand1.in0, nand1.in1]
    # Second NAND output to chip output
    - from: nand1.out0
      to: out0
